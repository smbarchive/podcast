…where we talk about Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in mathematical Biology

Dr. Stacey Finley is an Associate Professor of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Southern California. Her research is in mathematical oncology - she builds models to study biochemical networks inside cells and interactions between cells.

Prof. Zhilan Feng joined the Math Dept at Purdue University in 1996 and is currently a Program Director in the Math Biology program at NSF. She was elected a Fellow of the AMS in 2021. Zhilan enjoyed playing volleyball both in college and recreationally at Purdue.

We hear from them about their research, and get some tips for other budding math biologists.

As co-chairs of the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) Committee they are driving change as part of SMB’s ongoing commitment to cultivating an inclusive and equitable society. Tune in to learn how!
