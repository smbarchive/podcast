â€¦where we talk about a paper studying: who and when we should vaccinate.

After completing a DPhil in Statistics from the University of Oxford, focussing in epidemiology and phylogenetics, Matt now works as a data scientist for Italian football club Como 1907.
Matt was awarded the Lee A. Segel Prize for Best Student Paper published in [The Bulletin of Mathematical Biology: Asymptotic Analysis of Optimal Vaccination Policies](https://link.springer.com/journal/11538).
Join us to learn more about how this paper can help health professionals better assess the best way to distribute vaccines.
