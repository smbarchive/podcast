…where we talk about the biomechanics of brain fluids, and going on sabbatical

In his own words, Siv Sivaloganathan is:
“a mathematician working on problems in the biomedical sciences. Apart from research and contemplating the meaning of life - life is punctuated by periods of exercise and eating (often jogging towards good cuisine!), always in search of the perfect balance between exercise and dessert!”

His current research interests lie within:
Biomechanics
Mathematical modeling of hydrocephalus
Mathematical Oncology
