…where we talk immune systems, zombies and being presidential.

Jane Heffernan is a disease modeller. In her own words "My research aims to understand immunity development and maintenance in people, and in populations, after infection or vaccination. When I am not working, you can find me at soccer pitches or hockey arenas."

Jane’s current research interests lie within mathematical immunology and the modelling of waning and boosting immunity. Her lab is interested in understanding characteristics of pathogens, individual hosts, and populations that allow for disease spread and to determine public health and medical intervention strategies that will be needed to contain or eradicate infectious disease
