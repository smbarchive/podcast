…where we talk about a paper, studying: how cancer drugs work on cells in a layer vs. cells in a ball

In her own words, Sara Hamis is:
a mathematician who studies cancer. 
“My research focuses on understanding how the behavior of individual cells affects tumours as a whole. I am fuelled by grueling workouts, lady boss anthems, and terrible math puns.”

Sara was awarded the Lee A Segel Prize for the Best Paper published in [The Bulletin of Mathematical Biology](https://www.springer.com/journal/11538):
[Targeting Cellular DNA Damage Responses in Cancer: An In Vitro-Calibrated Agent-Based Model Simulating Monolayer and Spheroid Treatment Responses to ATR-Inhibiting Drugs](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11538-021-00935-y).

Join us to learn more about the work in this paper describing models of DNA-damaging drug effects on cancer cells in a flat layer in a dish, and cancer cells in a sphere.
