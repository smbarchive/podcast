…where we introduce a brand new podcast.

The Society for Mathematical Biology (SMB) was founded in 1973 to promote the development and dissemination of research and education at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences. It does so through its meetings, awards, and publications. The Society serves a diverse community of researchers and educators in academia, in industry, and government agencies throughout the world.

But what is Mathematical Biology? Why does it need a society? And who are these researchers and educators going to meetings, winning awards and publishing papers? 

Current president Dr. Heiko Enderling points us in the right direction, but you’ll have to listen in to: Biology in Numbers to learn more!
