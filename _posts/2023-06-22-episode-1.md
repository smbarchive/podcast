…where we talk about a paper studying: how to take your drugs on time.

In his own words, Elijah (Eli) Counterman is:
an undergraduate student at the University of Utah studying Applied Mathematics and Biochemistry. 
“I love all that Utah has to offer, from the red rocks in the south, to the pristine skiing 35 minutes from my driveway!”

Eli was awarded the Lee A Segel Prize for Best Student Paper published in The Bulletin of Mathematical Biology: 
Designing Drug Regimens that Mitigate Nonadherence.

Join us to learn more about how this paper can help us better understand what happens when patients miss drug doses.
