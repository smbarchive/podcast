…where we talk about infectious diseases, mentorship and mathematical tattoos.

Professor Stacey Smith? is an infectious disease modeler who appreciates the real world impacts that math biology can have. She leads educational and mentorship programming at the SMB and apparently never says no to anything SMB related. We caught Stacey at SMB 2024 in South Korea to talk about her research, life-changing transitions, and being a Whovian.

Check out Stacey’s website for science, articles and Sci-Fi nerdiness:
