…where we talk chemo brain, drug therapies, and a big meeting in Korea

Yangjin Kim is a bio-mathematician developing and analyzing various types of mathematical models for cancer research. I am very interested in creating a multi-scale hybrid mathematical model and developing anti-cancer strategies.

Yangjin’s current research interests lie within:
- Tumor microenvironments
- Chemo brain

Look up Yangjin’s website to find out more about his background and work:
