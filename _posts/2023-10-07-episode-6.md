…where we talk about studying flow through pipes, and creating an SMB subgroup

In his own words, Michael Watson is:
“an applied mathematician who uses mathematical models to study disease, development and physiology at the cell and tissue-scale.” 
Outside science, Mike is happiest when listening to music, catching up on "the fitba", and spending time with family.

His current research focus is the growth and formation of atherosclerotic plaques which block arteries.
